Hello, I am Ã–mer Sefa
I did cinema automation in this project.
I added the features that cinema automation should have such as film recording, actor recording, director recording, hall recording.
I used Microsoft SQL Server database in my project. I used C# tools for the tool.
I added the .exe extension installation file of my project to the project folder.
In order for this project to work on your computer, you must connect the project database that I added to the project folder to your own database server.
I added a Username and Password field to the login page to make it secure.
Username: admin
Password: 123
You can use the program using this username and password.
Thank you...
